#Initially I had a problem in classifying the data but then I understood the way. Here the new ml tweets are classified based on the prominent hashtags in the ml tweets. It seems the new ml tweets are classified as 'others' but it might be true as they would be different from the ml tweets.
#Here the classification is as follows: 1-bigdata, 2-analyt, 3-iot, 4-datasci, 5-job, 6-machinelarn, 7-hadoop, 8-data, 9-cloud and 10-others

#Polarity
ps <- polarity(mltweets[1:1000,1])
#scoring for all takes more than 25 minutes thus I am scoring the first 1000. I know it is less but it atleast gives a sense of the data and how this function works in R. Printing all:
ps
ps$all


#A custom polarity frame of positive-negative wirds and weights would be really helpful in the polarity score. This is because based on the data, the words can be chosen and wieghts can be alotted which would definitely improve the score.
#This was done when classifying positive and negative tweets in the L2 and would have a similar approach. I tried doing it as a dataframe but could not come up with a better method than simply applying for-loops.
