#This dataset is for Parkinsons patients giving the gait data.

names(data) <- c("time","ankle1","ankle2","ankle3","ul1","ul2","ul3","ta1","ta2","ta3","labels")

#This data consists of the ankle acceleration, upper leg acceleration and trunk acceleration with different subjects who are either healthy or have parkisons disease. This is a time series data which I am using in my project. Here I am using the information of a parkisons patient where the ankle data will be used to analyse using ARIMA models.

predictedData <- forecast(ankles_model,1000)

#Thus the future predicted 1000 values can be shown as:
plot(forecast(ankles_model, 1000))

#Looking at the plots of the predicted data and the actual data, it seems to be coninciding. Thus the arima models provides a best fit for the time series analysis for the dataset used by me. 
#Thus ARIMA can be used for prediction based on the model generated using the test dataset.
#The model parameters are as follows:
predictedData

#Just another way to show the future 1000 predictions with data in the positive as the acceleration values are positive in this particular dataset.
fit<-arima(ankles_timeseries,order=c(0,1,0))
plot(ankles_timeseries)
A.pred <- predict(fit,n.ahead=1000)
lines(A.pred$pred,col="red")
lines(A.pred$pred+2*A.pred$se,col="red",lty=3)

#Thus Arima model is used to predict the future values of a time series dataset and for the dataset I am using, it helps in prediction of the future values of the ankle acceleration and hereby helping in prediction of parkinsons disease in a person.

#NOTE: I have used only the acceleration data here but can also be applied to the speech data that I am using in my project.
